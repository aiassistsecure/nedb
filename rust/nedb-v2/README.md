This crate ships the **`nedbd`** binary — the NEDB v2 DAG HTTP server. Install it, point it at a data directory, and any language can speak to it over HTTP/JSON.

```bash
cargo install nedb-engine
nedbd ./data              # AOF engine (pure Rust, v1-compatible)
nedbd --dag ./data        # DAG engine (v2, content-addressed, recommended)
```

## ⚠️ New in 2.8.6 — Durability & Recovery (read this if you store anything you care about)

Three defects found by killing a real engine at every persistence boundary and by filling a real
filesystem to zero free blocks. All three are fixed. **If you are on 2.8.5 or earlier, upgrade.**

### 1. A failed flush silently discarded acknowledged writes

`IdIndex::flush_write_buf` cleared every buffered entry regardless of whether its disk write
succeeded. So a flush that hit `ENOSPC` threw the entry away, and no later flush retried it.

Reproduced on a full 22 MiB filesystem: **30 rows acknowledged by `put() -> Ok`, then `list()`
returned 0 after reopen — while `verify()` reported all 30 objects healthy.** The content-addressed
objects were durable; the id-index entries that make them findable were gone.

```
before:  try_flush_all() -> (no return value)      reopen -> 0 rows, verify() = 30 ok
after:   try_flush_all() -> Err("id-index leaf rows/buf_25: No space left on device (os error 28)")
         ...free space, retry -> Ok                reopen -> 30 rows
```

**Fixed:** an entry leaves the WAL only when its write actually landed. Failures stay buffered and
retry on the next flush.

### 2. Flush errors were unobservable — new `try_flush_all()`

`flush_all()` returns `()` and logged fsync failures to stderr, so a caller could not tell a durable
flush from a failed one. Anything that takes a destructive or externally-visible action on the
strength of a persisted record needs to know.

```rust
// Use this when the outcome matters:
db.try_flush_all()?;      // Result<()> — id-index WAL + segment sync + MANIFEST

// Still available, still logs, nowhere to propagate (ticker / Drop):
db.flush_all();
```

Also new: `Db::try_flush_manifest()` and `IdIndex::try_flush_write_buf()`.

### 3. `repair` could not repair, and `since()` claimed "caught up" while behind

The cold scan rebuilt `seq_index`, per-collection tips, the Merkle head and `MANIFEST` — but **never
the id index**. A database whose WAL never reached disk came back with every object verifying and
`list()` empty, and `nedb-cli repair` printed success without fixing it, because
`start_cold_scan()` is a deliberate no-op on a warm store.

```bash
nedb-cli repair ./data
# repaired: 203 id-index entr(ies) rebuilt, 203 node(s) verified, flushed
```

```rust
let restored = db.repair()?;   // rebuild id index from objects; highest seq wins
```

Every object carries its own `coll`, `id` and `seq`, so the id index is fully derivable — a lost WAL
is recoverable and nothing is invented. `repair()` also recomputes head and tips, so a repaired
database reopens **warm** instead of coming back up cold with an empty head.

Separately, `since()` set `has_more = hit_limit` alone. On a warm boot the seq index is empty **by
design** (that is why warm start is O(1)), so every lookup missed and `since()` returned zero nodes
with `has_more = false` — indistinguishable from genuinely up to date. A consumer following the
documented drain loop stopped one call in, with every record unread.

**Fixed:** `has_more` is true whenever the cursor is behind the log head. `ScanStatus` gains
**`seq_index_ready`** — replication consumers should gate on that, not on `scan_complete`, which is
true on a warm boot precisely because the scan was skipped.

### Known sharp edge (documented, not changed)

`since()`'s cursor is **exclusive** and seqs start at 0, so `since(0, _)` returns `(0, head]` and the
very first write in a database (seq 0) is unreachable through any cursor value. Ten writes drain as
nine records. Changing the convention would break existing consumers; a replica seeded from
`since()` alone starts one record short.

## What is NEDB v2?

NEDB v2 replaces the append-only log (AOF) with a **content-addressed Merkle DAG**:

- Every document version is an **immutable, BLAKE2b-hashed object**. Nothing is ever overwritten.
- Every write produces a new **chain head** — a BLAKE2b commitment over the entire database history.
- **Time-travel**: read any document `AS OF seq N` to see exactly what it contained at that point.
- **Causal provenance**: documents link to their causal parents via `caused_by` hashes. `TRACE caused_by` walks the full causal graph backward.
- **TRAVERSE**: named graph relations via `__links__`. `FROM person WHERE _id = "robert" TRAVERSE parent_of` returns linked nodes.
- **O(1) warm start**: a `MANIFEST` file stores `seq` + Merkle head so restarts never re-scan the entire object store.
- **Instant cold start**: the daemon accepts connections immediately; background scan loads objects incrementally.
- **AES-256-GCM at rest**: optional symmetric encryption with a double-envelope key structure (TMK wraps DEK).

## Cast — natural language into NQL

*Optional. Feature-gated, off by default.*

```bash
curl -X POST localhost:7070/v1/databases/shop/cast \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"prompt":"orders over 100"}'
```

```json
{
  "prompt": "orders over 100",
  "nql": "FROM orders WHERE total > 100",
  "valid": true,
  "collection": "orders",
  "collection_known": true,
  "collections": ["orders"],
  "executed": false,
  "seq": 3,
  "head": "262fd9…"
}
```

A **3.33M-parameter** model ([nedb-cast-slm](https://github.com/aiassistsecure/nedb-cast-slm)) turns a short English prompt into NQL. It runs locally on CPU in a few milliseconds. No API key, no network call, no tokens billed to anyone.

### Why this lives in the engine

The hard part of natural-language querying isn't the model — it's **knowing the schema**. A client has to fetch the collection list and pass it in, and it's stale the moment it arrives. The engine already holds the live list.

So the planner is constrained against real collections at the instant of the call:

```json
{ "prompt": "show me all stylists",
  "nql": "FROM stylists",
  "valid": true,
  "collection_known": false,
  "error": "collection \"stylists\" does not exist in \"shop\"" }
```

HTTP **422**. Not an empty result set — an empty result set reads as *"no matching rows"*, which would be a lie. The query was fine; the collection was imaginary.

Every `nedbd` client inherits this for free instead of reimplementing it.

### Three safety properties

**1 · The model never executes anything.** It emits text. That text goes to the same `nql::query` path a hand-typed query uses. There is no second executor to audit.

**2 · Validation is parsing, not pattern-matching.** `nql::parse` and `nql::execute` share one code path, so they cannot disagree about what is well-formed. Unparseable output returns 422 *with the offending text attached*.

**3 · `execute` defaults to `false`.** You get a plan for review. Opt in explicitly:

```bash
curl -X POST localhost:7070/v1/databases/shop/cast \
  -d '{"prompt":"orders over 100","execute":true}'
# → { …, "executed": true, "count": 2, "rows": [ … ] }
```

That default is not decoration. Here is a real miss, from a real run:

```
prompt   "paid orders over 100"
nql      FROM orders WHERE status = "paid" LIMIT 100      ← wrong
correct  FROM orders WHERE status = "paid" AND total > 100
```

It read *"over 100"* as `LIMIT 100` and dropped the second predicate. The row count still came back **2**, because both paid orders happened to exceed 100 — a count-only check would have called that a pass. A human reading `LIMIT 100` catches it instantly. An auto-executing client does not.

Multi-predicate `WHERE` is the model's weakest clause (**85.1%** eval / 61.2% holdout). Ship accordingly.

### The failure `valid` cannot catch

A literal the model **invented** rather than copied:

```
"memories about pricing"  ->  FROM memories SEARCH "handoff"
```

That query parses. It names a real collection. It returns real rows. Both
`valid` and `collection_known` are `true` — and it answers a question nobody
asked. Measured on the released checkpoint:

| terms | in vocabulary | copied correctly |
|---|---|---|
| `release flow` · `guardrail` · `handoff` | yes | **3/3** |
| `pricing` · `deadlines` · `kubernetes` | no | **0/3** — all became `"handoff"` |

So the response carries a `drift` field when a quoted literal is absent from the
prompt:

```json
{ "nql": "FROM memories SEARCH \"handoff\"",
  "valid": true,
  "collection_known": true,
  "drift": "generated the literal \"handoff\", which does not appear in the prompt — likely outside the model's vocabulary and substituted. Verify before trusting these results." }
```

It is **advisory, never fatal** — the plan may still be what you wanted, and
discarding a valid query would be its own kind of lie. But an unattended caller
should treat it as a third gate:

```python
if plan["valid"] and plan["collection_known"] and not plan.get("drift"):
    rows = await db.query(plan["nql"])
```

Same root cause as truncated digits (`height 400000` → `4000`): no copy
mechanism over prompt tokens. Verified at 24/24 on real model output — 3 true
positives, 21 true negatives, zero false alarms, including the case that matters
most (correctly inferred enum values like *"refunded orders"* → `status =
"refunded"` stay silent).

### Enabling it

Off by default because it pulls a model dependency and expects weights at runtime — most deployments want neither.

```bash
# 1. build with the feature
cargo install nedb-engine --features cast

# 2. get the weights (~13 MB)
curl -L -o model.cast \
  https://github.com/aiassistsecure/nedb-cast-slm/releases/download/v10.30.90/model.cast

# 3. run
nedbd --dag --cast ./data
#   cast     enabled — 3.33M params, vocab 581, ./data/model.cast
```

Model search order, first hit wins:

1. `$NEDBD_CAST_MODEL`
2. `<data_dir>/model.cast`
3. `$CAST_HOME/model.cast`
4. `~/.cache/nedb-cast-slm/v10.30.90/model.cast` — where the Python and npm packages cache it, so a machine that has run either one is already ready

The container is checksum-verified on load. A silently corrupt model would emit plausible-but-wrong queries, which is the worst possible failure mode for a query planner.

Without the feature the route still exists and returns **501** — so a client can detect the capability instead of guessing. Missing weights on a `--cast` build is loud but non-fatal: the daemon starts and serves everything else normally.

### As a library

```rust
use nedb_engine::cast::Caster;

let caster = Caster::load(&data_dir)?;
let out = caster.cast_checked("orders over 100", &db.id_index.collections());

if out.collection_known && nedb_engine::nql::parse(&out.nql).is_ok() {
    let (rows, count) = nedb_engine::nql::query(&db, &out.nql)?;
}
```

Decoding is greedy and deterministic — a DSL has exactly one right answer, so sampling could only hurt. The same prompt always produces the same plan, which makes the endpoint safe to cache.

## NQL — NEDB Query Language

```sql
-- Basic queries
FROM person LIMIT 10
FROM driver WHERE status = "active"
FROM driver WHERE rating >= 4.5 ORDER BY rating DESC

-- Time-travel
FROM will WHERE _id = "evans_will_2019" AS OF 5

-- Causal trace (walks caused_by links backward)
FROM event WHERE _id = "probate_filing" TRACE caused_by

-- Graph traversal
FROM person WHERE _id = "robert" TRAVERSE parent_of
```

---

## Example: The Will — causal DAG in action

```python
import json, os, urllib.request

def put(db_url, coll, id_, doc):
    body = json.dumps({"coll": coll, "id": id_, "doc": doc}).encode()
    req = urllib.request.Request(f"{db_url}/put", body,
          {"Content-Type": "application/json"}, method="POST")
    return json.loads(urllib.request.urlopen(req).read())["doc"]

BASE = "http://localhost:7070/v1/databases/will"

# Robert writes his will
robert = put(BASE, "person", "robert", {"name": "Robert Evans", "role": "testator"})
will_v1 = put(BASE, "will", "evans_will", {
    "house": "mark", "business": "lisa",
    "caused_by": [robert["_hash"]],   # causal link to testator record
})

# Amendment — chains off v1
will_v2 = put(BASE, "will", "evans_will", {
    "house": "mark", "business": "lisa", "vintage_car": "mark",
    "caused_by": [will_v1["_hash"]],
})

# TRACE proves the amendment links back to the original
query = json.dumps({"nql": 'FROM will WHERE _id = "evans_will" TRACE caused_by'}).encode()
req = urllib.request.Request(f"{BASE}/query", query,
      {"Content-Type": "application/json"}, method="POST")
trace = json.loads(urllib.request.urlopen(req).read())["rows"]
# → both versions + Robert's testator record, in causal order
```
