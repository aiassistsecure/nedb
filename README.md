## ⚠️ New in 2.8.6 — Durability & Recovery (read this if you store anything you care about)

Three defects found by killing a real engine at every persistence boundary and by filling a real
filesystem to zero free blocks. All three are fixed. **If you are on 2.8.5 or earlier, upgrade.**

### 1. A failed flush silently discarded acknowledged writes

`IdIndex::flush_write_buf` cleared every buffered entry regardless of whether its disk write
succeeded. So a flush that hit `ENOSPC` threw the entry away, and no later flush retried it.

Reproduced on a full 22 MiB filesystem: **30 rows acknowledged by `put() -> Ok`, then `list()`
returned 0 after reopen — while `verify()` reported all 30 objects healthy.** The content-addressed
objects were durable; the id-index entries that make them findable were gone.

```
before:  try_flush_all() -> (no return value)      reopen -> 0 rows, verify() = 30 ok
after:   try_flush_all() -> Err("id-index leaf rows/buf_25: No space left on device (os error 28)")
         ...free space, retry -> Ok                reopen -> 30 rows
```

**Fixed:** an entry leaves the WAL only when its write actually landed. Failures stay buffered and
retry on the next flush.

### 2. Flush errors were unobservable — new `try_flush_all()`

`flush_all()` returns `()` and logged fsync failures to stderr, so a caller could not tell a durable
flush from a failed one. Anything that takes a destructive or externally-visible action on the
strength of a persisted record needs to know.

```rust
// Use this when the outcome matters:
db.try_flush_all()?;      // Result<()> — id-index WAL + segment sync + MANIFEST

// Still available, still logs, nowhere to propagate (ticker / Drop):
db.flush_all();
```

Also new: `Db::try_flush_manifest()` and `IdIndex::try_flush_write_buf()`.

### 3. `repair` could not repair, and `since()` claimed "caught up" while behind

The cold scan rebuilt `seq_index`, per-collection tips, the Merkle head and `MANIFEST` — but **never
the id index**. A database whose WAL never reached disk came back with every object verifying and
`list()` empty, and `nedb-cli repair` printed success without fixing it, because
`start_cold_scan()` is a deliberate no-op on a warm store.

```bash
nedb-cli repair ./data
# repaired: 203 id-index entr(ies) rebuilt, 203 node(s) verified, flushed
```

```rust
let restored = db.repair()?;   // rebuild id index from objects; highest seq wins
```

Every object carries its own `coll`, `id` and `seq`, so the id index is fully derivable — a lost WAL
is recoverable and nothing is invented. `repair()` also recomputes head and tips, so a repaired
database reopens **warm** instead of coming back up cold with an empty head.

Separately, `since()` set `has_more = hit_limit` alone. On a warm boot the seq index is empty **by
design** (that is why warm start is O(1)), so every lookup missed and `since()` returned zero nodes
with `has_more = false` — indistinguishable from genuinely up to date. A consumer following the
documented drain loop stopped one call in, with every record unread.

**Fixed:** `has_more` is true whenever the cursor is behind the log head. `ScanStatus` gains
**`seq_index_ready`** — replication consumers should gate on that, not on `scan_complete`, which is
true on a warm boot precisely because the scan was skipped.

### Known sharp edge (documented, not changed)

`since()`'s cursor is **exclusive** and seqs start at 0, so `since(0, _)` returns `(0, head]` and the
very first write in a database (seq 0) is unreachable through any cursor value. Ten writes drain as
nine records. Changing the convention would break existing consumers; a replica seeded from
`since()` alone starts one record short.

## NEDB v2.8.0 — Production Stable

**Current stable: 2.8.0** — NEDB ships as **three version-aligned distributions** on one tag — `nedb-engine` (flagship), `crypto-database` (verifiable v2/v3 DAG), and `aof-db` (fast append-only) — across npm / PyPI / crates.io with full mac + linux + windows native addons (see [**Releasing**](#releasing) below). All native wheels (Linux + Windows on GitHub Actions; macOS arm64 + x86_64 on Codemagic M2 Mac Minis) **plus** the universal pure-Python wheel ship from a single `v*` tag, with the `nedbd-v2` binary bundled inside `pip install nedb-engine`.

### New in 2.8.0 — Cast: the database understands English

`POST /v1/databases/<name>/cast` turns a short English prompt into NQL, using a **3.33M-parameter model that runs locally on CPU**. No API key, no network call, no per-token bill.

```bash
nedbd --dag --cast ./data     # requires: cargo install nedb-engine --features cast

curl -X POST localhost:7070/v1/databases/shop/cast \
  -d '{"prompt":"orders over 100"}'
# → {"nql":"FROM orders WHERE total > 100","valid":true,"collection_known":true,"executed":false}
```

The model ([**nedb-cast-slm**](https://github.com/aiassistsecure/nedb-cast-slm)) was trained on NQL using NEDB's own parser as generator, grader, and gate — then shipped to PyPI, crates.io, and npm, all three loading the identical weights.

**Why it lives in the engine and not in a client:** the hard part of natural-language querying is knowing the schema, and the engine already holds the live collection list. A plan naming a collection that doesn't exist returns **422 with the reason**, never a silently empty result set. See [**Cast**](#cast--natural-language-into-nql) below.

Off by default — feature-gated at compile time, flag-gated at runtime, and `execute` defaults to `false` so you review the plan before it runs.

**Also in 2.8.0 — an engine bug the feature exposed.** `IdIndex::collections()` did a bare `read_dir` while every other read path overlaid the WAL write buffer, so a brand-new collection was invisible until the 1s flush ticker fired. Unreachable by hand (the ticker fires between keystrokes) but reliable from a script, and latent in `Db::compact()` too, where a missed collection's live objects would be reclaimed as garbage. Fixed, with regression tests that seed *without* flushing.

**New in 2.5.x:**

- **Durable-mode auto-flush-on-exit** — a durable store flushes buffered writes on `Ctrl+C` / `SIGTERM`, not just on a clean `Drop`. Automatic in the Node and Python bindings; `Db::install_exit_flush(Arc<Db>)` for standalone Rust binaries. See [**docs/DURABILITY.md**](docs/DURABILITY.md).
- **2.8.5 — embedded bindings flush on a cadence.** `NedbCore.open()` (Node + Python) now runs the 1 s manifest ticker exactly as `nedbd` does, so a `SIGKILL` / OOM / power cut loses at most one tick of acknowledged writes instead of everything since open. `NEDB_FLUSH_MS` tunes or disables it. See [docs/DURABILITY.md](docs/DURABILITY.md).
- **`nedb-cli`** — operate on a store directory offline (`head` · `status` · `verify` · `get` · `scan` · `flush` · `repair` · `export`), and **`nedb-inspector`** — a deterministic (no-regex, no-LLM) checker that warns when a durable open lacks flush-on-exit wiring. See [**docs/CLI.md**](docs/CLI.md).
- **Replication contract** — `tip()` (the latest write), a bounded `since()` changefeed, and a `scan_status()` readiness gate. See [**docs/REPLICATION.md**](docs/REPLICATION.md).

**The v3 storage line — consolidated, spec'd, and (as of 2.4.3) cleanly published across every platform.** It makes the NEDB **v3 segment/pack object store** a first-class, fully-documented feature:

- **`--dag-v3`** (opt-in) — append-only segment store: one `fsync` per group-commit, `.idx` sidecars, compaction, non-destructive dual-read. Took a real itcd chainstate flush from *minutes* to **~1.3 s**. Parsed as a real flag by `nedbd-v2` as of v2.4.3 (or set `NEDB_DAG_V3=1`). (See the v3 section below.)
- **`NEDB_FAST_FSYNC`** — macOS fast-fsync: a plain `fsync(2)` instead of `F_FULLFSYNC` (default off; no-op on Linux/Windows).
- Durable **flush-on-close** — and, as of 2.5.x, **flush-on-exit** on `Ctrl+C` / `SIGTERM` (see [**docs/DURABILITY.md**](docs/DURABILITY.md)) — a **Windows-safe id-index** (percent-encodes filesystem-unsafe ids), and idempotent object re-writes.
- **`docs/SPEC.md` §3** now formally specifies the v2 object store, the v3 substrate, and the durability model.

NEDB v2 replaces the append-only log (AOF) with a **content-addressed Merkle DAG**. Every document version is an immutable, BLAKE2b-verified object. Nothing is ever overwritten. As of **v2.2.31**, restarts after the first open are **O(1) warm starts** (driven by a `MANIFEST` of `seq` + Merkle head), the **cold scan is deferred** so the daemon accepts connections immediately, and a new **`GET /events` SSE endpoint** streams scan progress + per-write events live.

```bash
# Run the v2 DAG engine — ships inside pip install nedb-engine
nedbd --dag --data ./data
# or
NEDBD_DAG=1 NEDB_TMK=<32-byte-hex> nedbd --data ./data

curl http://127.0.0.1:7070/health
# {"ok":true,"version":"2.2.31","service":"nedbd","engine":"dag","startup_ready":true,"encrypted":true}

# Tail the live event stream (new in v2.2.31)
curl http://127.0.0.1:7070/events
# event: scan   data: {"objects":730000,"of":1310703,"rate":21043,"eta_s":28}
# event: ready  data: {"seq":1310703,"head":"b2:9c14e07a…"}
# event: write  data: {"seq":1310704,"coll":"beliefs","head":"b2:7af3c11e…"}
```

---

## Python — 5-minute tour

```python
from nedb import NEDB

db = NEDB("./mydata")          # durable: every op is AOF-logged, fsync'd, and hash-chained
# db = NEDB()                  # or in-memory

db.create_index("users", "status", "eq")
db.create_index("users", "bio",    "search")

db.put("users", "alice", {"name": "Alice", "age": 31, "status": "active", "bio": "rust hacker"})
db.put("users", "bob",   {"name": "Bob",   "age": 24, "status": "active", "bio": "python dev"})

# NQL: WHERE + ORDER BY + LIMIT + SEARCH + TRAVERSE + GROUP BY
db.query('FROM users WHERE status = "active" ORDER BY age ASC')
db.query('FROM users SEARCH "rust"')
db.query('FROM users GROUP BY status COUNT')

# Time-travel — AS OF any past sequence
snap = db.seq
db.put("users", "alice", {"name": "Alice", "age": 32, "status": "retired"})
db.get("users", "alice", as_of=snap)          # → age 31, status active

# Bi-temporal — VALID AS OF any past date
db.put("policy", "rate_2024", {"pct": 5.0}, valid_from="2024-01-01", valid_to="2024-12-31")
db.put("policy", "rate_2025", {"pct": 6.0}, valid_from="2025-01-01")
db.query('FROM policy VALID AS OF "2024-06-15"')   # → rate 5.0

# Causal Write Provenance — why did this write happen?
db.put("inputs", "msg_1", {"text": "user prefers dark mode"})
seq_msg = db.seq
db.put("beliefs", "dark_mode", {"value": True},
       caused_by=[seq_msg], evidence="user_message", confidence=0.95)
db.query('FROM beliefs WHERE _id = "dark_mode" TRACE caused_by')   # → msg_1
db.query('FROM inputs WHERE _id = "msg_1" TRACE caused_by REVERSE') # → dark_mode

# Relations + graph traversal
db.link("users:alice", "follows", "users:bob")
db.query('FROM users WHERE _id = "alice" TRAVERSE follows')

# Hash-chain integrity
assert db.verify()             # cryptographic proof — no tampering

# SQL, Redis, MongoDB compatibility adapters
from nedb import sql_exec, RedisCompat, MongoClient
sql_exec(db, "SELECT * FROM users WHERE status = 'active' ORDER BY age DESC")
r = RedisCompat(db); r.execute("HSET", "user:1", "name", "Alice")
MongoClient(db)["users"].find({"status": "active"}).sort("age", -1).to_list()
```

## Official Python client — talk to nedbd over HTTP

Running the daemon? `nedb.client.NedbClient` is the official client for its
HTTP API — extracted from the battle-tested clients that ran a production
Redis→NEDB mainnet migration, speaking the full route surface: queries,
atomic CAS transactions, TTL, indexes, relations, Merkle proofs, and the
Mongo-compat endpoint. Env-var defaults (`NEDBD_URL`, `NEDBD_TOKEN`,
`NEDB_DB`) mirror the daemon's own.

```python
from nedb import NedbClient, PreconditionFailed, op_put

c = NedbClient("http://127.0.0.1:7070", db="app", token="s3cret")
c.ensure_database()

c.put("users", "u1", {"id": "u1", "email": "a@b.c"}, idem="signup-u1")
c.query('FROM users WHERE email = "a@b.c"')      # full NQL rides through
c.query("FROM users AS OF 41")                    # time-travel included

# Atomic all-or-nothing transaction with engine-checked preconditions —
# the primitive that replaces Redis Lua scripts (if_seq: N = CAS, -1 = create-once)
doc = c.get_doc("users", "u1")                    # docs carry _seq
c.tx([op_put("users", "u1", {**doc, "plan": "pro"}, if_seq=doc["_seq"])])

# Contested writes: retry ONLY on PreconditionFailed, capped backoff
def bump():
    d = c.get_doc("counters", "hits") or {"n": 0}
    return c.tx([op_put("counters", "hits", {"n": d.get("n", 0) + 1},
                        if_seq=d.get("_seq", -1))])
c.cas_retry(bump)

# Integrity, verifiable WITHOUT trusting the server
proof = c.proof(c.log(limit=1)[0]["hash"])
from nedb import verify_proof; verify_proof(proof)  # -> True, locally
```

A CAS miss raises the **same `PreconditionFailed`** (with the same
`.failures` shape) the embedded engine raises — code written against
`NEDB.tx` ports to the HTTP client without changing its except-clauses.
Typed errors throughout: `NedbAuthError`, `NedbNotFound`, `NedbBadRequest`,
`NedbConflict`, `CasExhausted`.

## The wrap adapter family — provenance for the databases you already run

**One line. Any stack.** Wrap your existing connection and gain tamper-evident, causally-provable, bi-temporal storage *alongside* your app — no migration, no rip-and-replace. NEDB never touches your namespace; shadow data lives only in the embedded DAG engine.

| Language | Package | Redis | SQLite | MySQL | MongoDB | PostgreSQL |
|---|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Python | `pip install nedb-engine` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Node.js | `npm install nedb-engine` → `require('nedb-engine/wrap')` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Rust | `nedb-wrap` (crates.io) | ✅ (`redis` feature) | 📋 engine-direct | 📋 engine-direct | 📋 engine-direct | 📋 engine-direct |

✅ adapter shipped · 📋 embed the DAG core directly (`Surface` trait, same contract)

The same contract everywhere — register → backfill → shadow → full NEDB API:

```python
# Python — every write auto-chained
import redis, json
from nedb import wrap_redis

r = wrap_redis(redis.Redis("localhost", 6379), db_name="rideshare",
               dag_path="./nedb-data")          # embedded v2/v3 DAG — no server
r.nedb.register("driver:*", "driver", value_parser=json.loads)
r.nedb.backfill()
r.nedb.shadow_writes = True
r.set("driver:d1", json.dumps({"name": "Bob", "status": "active"}))
r.nedb.query('FROM driver WHERE status = "active"')
r.nedb.verify()   # → True — BLAKE2b chain intact
```

```js
// Node.js — same shape, real Rust DAG core via napi-rs
const { wrapRedis } = require('nedb-engine/wrap');
const r = wrapRedis(redisClient, { dbName: 'rideshare', dagPath: './nedb-data' });
r.nedb.register('driver:*', 'driver');
r.nedb.shadowWrites = true;
await r.set('driver:d1', JSON.stringify({ name: 'Bob' }));
r.nedb.query('FROM driver');
```

```rust
// Rust — embed the engine directly (nedb-wrap crate)
use nedb_wrap::Surface;
let s = Surface::in_memory();               // or Surface::open(path)?
s.register("driver:*", "driver");
s.shadow_writes.store(true, std::sync::atomic::Ordering::Relaxed);
s.shadow("driver:d1", serde_json::json!({"name": "Bob"}), true)?;
assert!(s.verify());
```

Engine selection (all languages): `nedbd` HTTP server if you point at one (v1 AOF, `--dag` v2, `--dag-v3` v3) → **embedded DAG** if the native wheel is installed → v1 in-process fallback. Pass `dag_path=` for a durable store, `dag_tmk=` for AES-256-GCM encryption.

## Redis layer-2 — wrap_redis() in depth

Already running on Redis? Wrap your connection in one line and gain NEDB features *alongside* your existing Redis app — no migration required.

```python
import redis, json
from nedb import wrap_redis

r = wrap_redis(redis.Redis("localhost", 6379), db_name="rideshare")

# Step 1 — register: map Redis key globs to NEDB collections (chainable)
(r.nedb
 .register("driver:*", collection="driver", value_parser=json.loads)
 .register("trip:*",   collection="trip",   value_type="hash")
)

# Step 2 — backfill: import all existing Redis data into NEDB in one pass
imported = r.nedb.backfill()           # → int (keys imported)

# Step 3 — shadow: all future r.set/hset/... auto-chain into NEDB
r.nedb.shadow_writes = True

# ─── Alice's app keeps running — zero changes ───────────────────────────
r.set("driver:d1", json.dumps({"name": "Bob", "status": "active"}))   # ← shadowed
r.hset("trip:t1", mapping={"status": "en_route", "driver_id": "d1"})  # ← shadowed

# ─── New features available on the same connection ──────────────────────
r.nedb.query('FROM driver WHERE status = "active" ORDER BY lat ASC')
r.nedb.verify()       # → True  (every write chain-verified)
r.nedb.head()         # → 64-char BLAKE2b commitment hash
```

**Isolation guarantee:** NEDB never writes to Alice's namespace. It owns only:

| Key | Type | Purpose |
|-----|------|---------|
| `nedb:{db_name}:oplog` | Redis Stream | append-only op log |
| `nedb:{db_name}:snapshot` | Redis Hash | checkpoint |
| `nedb:{db_name}:meta` | Redis Hash | index config |

See [`examples/fakeredis_demo.py`](examples/fakeredis_demo.py) for a full local demo (no Redis server needed).

---

## Node.js

```javascript
import { NedbCore } from "nedb-engine";

const db = new NedbCore();               // in-memory
// const db = NedbCore.open("./data");   // durable

db.createIndex("users", "status", "eq");
db.put("users", "alice", JSON.stringify({ name: "Alice", age: 31, status: "active" }));

// Time-travel
const snap = db.seq();                   // BigInt
db.put("users", "alice", JSON.stringify({ name: "Alice", age: 32, status: "retired" }));
JSON.parse(db.getAsOf("users", "alice", snap)).age;  // → 31

// Full NQL
const rows = db.query('FROM users WHERE status = "active" ORDER BY age ASC');
rows.map(r => JSON.parse(r));

// Tamper evidence
db.verify();   // → true
db.head();     // → 64-char BLAKE2b commitment hash
db.seq();      // → BigInt
```

## nedbd — the concurrent server daemon

nedbd runs NEDB as a long-lived process with an HTTP/JSON API and an optional RESP2 wire protocol. Built on a **single-writer group-commit sequencer** — parallel reads, batched durable writes, one hash-chain per database, zero write-write races.

```bash
nedbd                                     # :7070, data ./nedb-data (v1 AOF engine)
nedbd --dag --data ./data                 # v2 DAG engine (or NEDBD_DAG=1)
NEDBD_RESP2_PORT=6380 nedbd               # also speak RESP2 (redis-cli compatible)
nedbd --log-level 2                       # 0=errors 1=requests 2=deploy 3=verbose

# Live event stream (new in v2.2.31) — SSE: scan progress, ready, per-write head
curl http://127.0.0.1:7070/events
```

### Companion CLIs

Alongside the daemon, `cargo install nedb-engine` ships **`nedb-cli`** — operate on a store directory offline (`head`/`status`/`verify`/`get`/`scan`/`flush`/`repair`/`export`) — and **`nedb-inspector`**, a deterministic checker that warns when a durable open lacks flush-on-exit wiring. Full reference: [**docs/CLI.md**](docs/CLI.md).

### Startup modes (v2.2.31)

- **Warm start** — every restart after the first open reads the `MANIFEST` file and restores `seq` + Merkle `head` in **O(1)**. No scan, no replay, independent of dataset size. Boots in milliseconds.
- **Cold start** — first open of an existing dataset spawns the integrity scan in a background thread *and accepts connections immediately*. Reads serve instantly from the content-addressed DAG; writes return `HTTP 503 startup in progress` until the `startup_ready` gate flips. Progress (objects, rate, ETA) streams over `GET /events`.

### Environment variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `NEDBD_DAG` | `0` | Set `1` to launch the v2 DAG engine (`nedbd-v2`). Same as `--dag`. |
| `NEDBD_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | Bind address. **v2.2.31** defaults to loopback (was `0.0.0.0`) — security hardening fix. Set explicitly to `0.0.0.0` to expose. |

## NQL — the NEDB Query Language

```
FROM <collection>
  [ AS OF <seq> ]                            transaction time (when was it written?)
  [ VALID AS OF "<date>" ]                   valid time (when was it true in the world?)
  [ WHERE <field> <op> <value> (AND ...) ]   op: = != < <= > >=
  [ SEARCH "<text>" ]                        full-text search
  [ ORDER BY <field> [ASC|DESC] ]
  [ TRAVERSE <relation> ]                    graph traversal
  [ TRACE caused_by [REVERSE] ]              causal provenance (why? / what did this cause?)
  [ LIMIT <n> ]
  [ GROUP BY <field> [COUNT|SUM f|AVG f|MIN f|MAX f] ]
```

Combine both time axes:
```python
# What did the system know at seq 200 about what was true on 2024-02-15?
db.query('FROM policy AS OF 200 VALID AS OF "2024-02-15"')
```

## Cast — natural language into NQL

*New in 2.8.0. Optional, feature-gated, off by default.*

Ten clauses and six operators. That's the whole grammar above — small enough that a **3.33M-parameter** model can learn it completely, and small enough that shipping every query to a frontier model is an absurd amount of machinery.

So we trained one. It runs on CPU, in-process, in milliseconds.

```bash
curl -X POST localhost:7070/v1/databases/shop/cast \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"prompt":"orders over 100"}'
```

```json
{
  "prompt": "orders over 100",
  "nql": "FROM orders WHERE total > 100",
  "valid": true,
  "collection": "orders",
  "collection_known": true,
  "collections": ["orders"],
  "executed": false,
  "seq": 3,
  "head": "262fd9…"
}
```

### NEDB is on both ends of this

The model is [**nedb-cast-slm**](https://github.com/aiassistsecure/nedb-cast-slm), and NEDB built it as much as it consumes it.

**NEDB's parser was the training pipeline.** It generated the corpus (sample a random plan → render NQL → render a human paraphrase; 200,000 pairs in 16.5 seconds, perfect labels, zero annotation cost). It was the grader — scoring *parsed plan* equality, not string equality, so `FROM orders WHERE total > 99` and `from orders where total>99` both earn full credit. And it was the gate: no example entered the corpus unless it round-tripped through the real parser to a canonically identical plan.

> Most text-to-DSL projects hand-write a verifier and hope it's right. We didn't write one — it already shipped, and it's the same code the database runs in production.

**Training lineage lives in NEDB too**, chained by `caused_by`:

```
datasets ──▶ training_runs ──▶ checkpoints ──▶ evals
```

```python
db.query("FROM evals TRACE caused_by")   # the exact data behind any score
```

### Why the planner lives in the engine

The hard part of natural-language querying is not the model. It's the **schema** — and a client has to fetch the collection list and pass it in, where it's stale on arrival. The engine already holds the live list.

So the plan is checked against collections that actually exist, at the moment of the call:

```json
{ "prompt": "show me all stylists",
  "nql": "FROM stylists",
  "valid": true,
  "collection_known": false,
  "error": "collection \"stylists\" does not exist in \"shop\"" }
```

HTTP **422**. Not zero rows — zero rows reads as *"no matching data"*, which would be a lie. The query was perfectly well-formed; the collection was imagined. That's the model's known failure mode on an unfamiliar schema, and the engine is the one component positioned to catch it.

Every `nedbd` client — Python, Node, Studio, `curl` — inherits this without writing a line.

### Three safety properties

| | |
|---|---|
| **The model never executes** | It emits text. The text goes to the same `nql::query` path a hand-typed query uses. No second executor exists to audit. |
| **Validation is parsing** | `nql::parse` and `nql::execute` share one code path, so they cannot disagree about what is well-formed. Invalid output returns 422 *with the offending text*. |
| **`execute` defaults to false** | You get a plan for review. Running a guess silently is worse than admitting uncertainty. |

That last default earns its keep. A real miss, from a real run:

```
prompt   "paid orders over 100"
nql      FROM orders WHERE status = "paid" LIMIT 100      ← wrong
correct  FROM orders WHERE status = "paid" AND total > 100
```

It read *"over 100"* as `LIMIT 100` and dropped the predicate. The count still came back **2** — because both paid orders happened to exceed 100. A count-only assertion would have scored it a pass. A human reading `LIMIT 100` catches it in a heartbeat; an auto-executing client does not.

Multi-predicate `WHERE` is the model's weakest clause: **85.1%** exact-plan match on eval, 61.2% on adversarial holdout. The [model card](https://github.com/aiassistsecure/nedb-cast-slm#what-it-gets-wrong) documents every failure mode with examples.

To run it anyway, ask:

```bash
curl -X POST localhost:7070/v1/databases/shop/cast \
  -d '{"prompt":"orders over 100","execute":true}'
# → { …, "executed": true, "count": 2, "rows": [ … ] }
```

### The failure `valid` cannot catch

A literal the model **invented** rather than copied:

```
"memories about pricing"  ->  FROM memories SEARCH "handoff"
```

That query parses. It names a real collection. It returns real rows. Both
`valid` and `collection_known` are `true` — and it answers a question nobody
asked. Measured on the released checkpoint:

| terms | in vocabulary | copied correctly |
|---|---|---|
| `release flow` · `guardrail` · `handoff` | yes | **3/3** |
| `pricing` · `deadlines` · `kubernetes` | no | **0/3** — all became `"handoff"` |

So the response carries a `drift` field when a quoted literal is absent from the
prompt:

```json
{ "nql": "FROM memories SEARCH \"handoff\"",
  "valid": true,
  "collection_known": true,
  "drift": "generated the literal \"handoff\", which does not appear in the prompt — likely outside the model's vocabulary and substituted. Verify before trusting these results." }
```

It is **advisory, never fatal** — the plan may still be what you wanted, and
discarding a valid query would be its own kind of lie. But an unattended caller
should treat it as a third gate:

```python
if plan["valid"] and plan["collection_known"] and not plan.get("drift"):
    rows = await db.query(plan["nql"])
```

Same root cause as truncated digits (`height 400000` → `4000`): no copy
mechanism over prompt tokens. Verified at 24/24 on real model output — 3 true
positives, 21 true negatives, zero false alarms, including the case that matters
most (correctly inferred enum values like *"refunded orders"* → `status =
"refunded"` stay silent).

### Enabling it

Two gates, because most deployments want neither the model dependency nor the weights:

```bash
# compile-time
cargo install nedb-engine --features cast

# or from a source checkout — builds the engine only, not the language bindings
cd rust && cargo build --release --features cast

# weights (~13 MB) — GitHub release asset, checksum-verified on load
curl -L -o ./data/model.cast \
  https://github.com/aiassistsecure/nedb-cast-slm/releases/download/v10.30.90/model.cast

# runtime
nedbd --dag --cast ./data
#   cast     enabled — 3.33M params, vocab 581, ./data/model.cast
```

Search order: `$NEDBD_CAST_MODEL` → `<data_dir>/model.cast` → `$CAST_HOME/model.cast` → `~/.cache/nedb-cast-slm/v10.30.90/model.cast` (the Python/npm cache location, so a machine that has run either package is already ready).

Built without the feature, the route returns **501** rather than 404 — clients can detect the capability instead of guessing. Built with it but missing weights, the daemon logs loudly and serves everything else normally.

**Verify the whole path:**

```bash
./scripts/test-cast.sh --boot     # boots a daemon, seeds, casts, executes, checks failure modes
```

### Casting from a shell

```bash
./scripts/seed-shop.sh       # a shop database the model already understands
. ./scripts/nedb.sh          # bash / zsh / Git Bash

nedb-dbs                     # which databases exist
nedb-use shop                # pick one
cast "orders over 100"       # plan only — nothing runs
cast -x "orders over 100"    # plan AND execute
```

**Seed the names it was trained on.** The model learned six synthetic domains, and `shop` is one of them — `orders(total, status, quantity, customer, placed_at, discounted)`, `products(price, stock, category, rating, title)`, `customers(age, city, tier, lifetime_value, name)`, plus the relations `purchased` / `reviewed` / `belongs_to`. Those names live in its 581-token vocabulary.

Call your collection `purchases` with a `cost` field and it will still emit `FROM orders WHERE total > …`, because that is what it knows. It is a 3.3M-parameter model, not a schema reader. On an unfamiliar schema you get `collection_known: false` — caught, not silently wrong, but caught.

```
  nql         FROM orders WHERE total > 100
  valid       yes    collection orders known: yes
  executed    no  (add -x to run it)
```

The summary leads with the NQL because **reading it is the job**. `valid: yes` means it parses, not that it's what you meant — `LIMIT 100` parses perfectly.

`NEDB=http://host:7070` points at a remote daemon. Prompts are JSON-escaped, so apostrophes and quotes are safe.

### Prompts it handles well

Accuracy varies by clause, so phrasing matters more than length:

| you want | say | eval |
|---|---|---|
| `TRACE caused_by` | *what caused these checkpoints* | 96.5% |
| `TRAVERSE` | *orders traverse placed_by* | 93.3% |
| one `WHERE` | *orders over 100* · *active drivers* | 91.2% |
| `LIMIT` | *top 5 orders* | 91.1% |
| `SEARCH` | *search orders for refund* | 90.5% |
| `ORDER BY` | *orders sorted by total descending* | 87.7% |
| two+ `WHERE` | *paid orders with total over 100* | 85.1% |
| `GROUP BY` + agg | *orders grouped by status with sum of total* | 77.0% |

Two habits that avoid most misses:

- **Name the field** when a number could be a limit. *"orders with total over 100"* beats *"orders over 100"* — bare *"over N"* is what produced the `LIMIT 100` miss above.
- **Check numbers over four digits.** Digits are tokenized one at a time, so `height 400000` can come back `4000`.

## Performance

**v2 DAG Rust server (v2.2.31, Intel iMac — 10k writes / 100k reads / 30k objects, AES-256-GCM on):**

| Operation | Throughput | p50 | p99 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Sequential writes | **418 ops/s** | 2.3 ms | 3.3 ms |
| Point-lookup reads | **478 ops/s** | 2.0 ms | 3.0 ms |
| ORDER BY queries | **489 ops/s** | 1.8 ms | 4.3 ms |
| Batch writes (500 ops/req) | **1,104 ops/s** | 0.9 ms | 1.2 ms |
| Tamper-verify (30k objects) | ~21,000 BLAKE2b/sec | — | 1.38 s total |

p99 latencies hold because of `TCP_NODELAY` on the axum listener — without it macOS loopback adds the Nagle algorithm's 40–200 ms delay on small writes.

**v1 Python server (baseline — single-threaded AOF):**

| Operation | Throughput | p99 latency |
|---|---|---|
| Sequential PUT | ~23/s | 44 ms |
| Concurrent PUT (16 workers) | ~92/s | 48 ms |
| Batch PUT (500 ops/request) | ~520 ops/s | 1.9 ms/op |
| Point-lookup read (NQL) | ~23/s | 44 ms |
| Rust napi PUT (FFI) | ~70K/s | — |
| Rust napi GET (FFI) | ~330K/s | — |

Reproduce with the included benchmark:

```bash
NEDBD_DAG=1 nedbd --data /tmp/perf &
python3 tests/test_dag_perf.py --n 10000 --reads 100000

## NEDB v3 — Segment / Pack Object Store

**v3 is an opt-in storage substrate that replaces the loose one-file-per-object layout with append-only *segment packs* — the difference between a chainstate flush that takes *minutes* and one that takes *under two seconds*.** It is **off by default** (byte-for-byte v2), enabled with one flag, and **transparent** to everything above the storage layer: NQL, `AS OF`, `VALID AS OF`, `TRACE`, the BLAKE2b Merkle head, and causal provenance all behave identically.

### Why it exists

v2 stores every document version as its own content-addressed file at `objects/{hash[:2]}/{hash[2:]}`. That makes writes trivially atomic (write `.tmp` → `rename`) and corruption-proof — but each write costs a file create + `fsync` + rename **plus** a directory B-tree update. At scale that filesystem-metadata churn dominates: on a busy disk it caps sustained writes around **~185/s**, and a batch flush of a few thousand objects degrades into minutes. The bottleneck is the *number of files touched*, not the bytes written.

### What it does

v3 batches objects into append-only **segment packs** — `objects/segments/seg-NNNNNN.dat` — where each record is `[content_len: u32-LE][content]`. A write appends to the active segment and updates an in-memory `hash → (segment_id, offset, len)` map; a batch commits with a **single `fsync`**. Thousands of per-file syscalls collapse into one sequential append plus one durability point, so **flush cost scales with bytes (sequential I/O), not object-count × syscall overhead.**

- **Compaction / pruning** — `compact()` keeps the *live set* (the current version of every document, resolved from the id-index), rewrites those records into fresh segments, and reclaims the superseded/dead versions.
- **`.idx` sidecars** — each segment carries a sidecar (`NIX1` magic + entry count + fixed 44-byte entries + a BLAKE2b-256 checksum) so reopen rebuilds the in-memory index by reading the sidecar instead of scanning the whole pack. A missing or corrupt sidecar falls back to a full scan-and-heal — slower, never fatal.
- **Dual-read migration** — opening an existing v2 store in v3 mode is **non-destructive**: old loose objects stay fully readable, and only *new* writes go to segments. No migration step, no downtime, no rewrite.
- **Durable flush-on-close** — `flush_all()` (and `Db`'s `Drop`) fsync the active segment, matching the flush-on-close contract of sled / RocksDB.

### How to enable

```bash
# Engine / nedbd-v2 (the native daemon from npm / the native wheel)
nedbd-v2 --dag-v3 --data /var/lib/nedb     # real flag as of v2.4.3 — or set NEDB_DAG_V3=1

# itcd — Bitcoin-fork node embedding NEDB via nedb-ffi
interchainedd -dagv3                        # puts chainstate AND block index on segments
```

The switch is read once, when each database's object store is constructed at open time. Default off → v2 loose objects.

### Real-world result

itcd (a Bitcoin Core 0.21 fork that replaces LevelDB chainstate with NEDB) syncing on `-dagv3`, measured `FlushStateToDisk` on real chainstate:

| Flush (coins → disk) | v3 segment store | v2 loose store |
|---|---|---|
| 2,002 coins / 275 kB | **1.93 s** | *minutes* |
| 2,549 coins / 366 kB | **1.71 s** | *minutes* |

Note the *larger* batch finishing *faster* — v3's cost is dominated by the single per-batch `fsync`, not per-coin work, so effective throughput (~1,000–1,500 coins/s here) climbs as batches grow, against the loose store's ~185 writes/s metadata ceiling. The gap only widens as the UTXO set grows: sequential-append cost tracks data volume, while per-file cost compounds with object count.

### When to use it

Reach for v3 on high-write, large-object-count workloads — blockchain chainstate / block index, event sourcing, high-frequency agent memory. For small or read-mostly stores the loose layout is perfectly fine, which is exactly why v3 stays opt-in.

## Releasing

NEDB and its two distributions (`crypto-database`, `aof-db`) ship from a **single version tag** via one committed tool:

```bash
python3 scripts/release.py "vFROM" "vTO"
# e.g. the first run of the 2.4.468 line:
python3 scripts/release.py "v2.4.68" "v2.4.468"
```

Both arguments require the leading `v` (e.g. `v2.4.468`). The script:

1. **Bumps every version-bearing manifest** (npm / PyPI / crates + the engine crate, clients, and the maturin project) in the flagship **and** both distribution forks from `FROM` to `TO`, opening and merging a release PR per repo.
2. **Repoints the `distributions/*` submodules** to the freshly-bumped fork masters.
3. **Tags `vTO`** on `master`, firing CI/CD — `release.yml` (flagship) + `release-distros.yml` (distros) + Codemagic (macOS wheels/addons) — to publish `nedb-engine` + `crypto-database` + `aof-db` aligned on one version across npm, PyPI, and crates.io.

It is **idempotent**: a manifest line already at `TO` is left untouched, a repo already fully at `TO` produces no empty PR, and an existing `vTO` tag is left in place — so a half-finished release can be re-run safely, and the remaining steps (submodule repoint, tag) always run even when the version was already correct.

Requires `GITHUB_TOKEN` (`repo` + `workflow` scope) in the environment. It never force-pushes `master` and never commits to it directly — every change lands through a branch + PR + merge.
