## ⚠️ Upgrade your server to nedbd 3.2.0

This client talks to `nedbd`, so its durability comes from the server. **Upgrade if you are on
anything earlier than 3.2.0.**

**3.2.0 — the embedded engine was pinning its own data directory.** The background flush ticker held
a strong reference to the database in a loop that never exited, so the handle was never dropped: the
exclusive data-dir `LOCK` was never released, reopening the same path in the same process failed with
"locked by another process" naming your *own* pid, and every open leaked a thread and the whole
database for the life of the process. Live in **2.8.5 through 3.1.0**.

**2.8.6 fixed three defects in 2.8.5 and earlier** — a flush that hit a full disk silently discarded
acknowledged writes, flush failures were unobservable, and `nedb-cli repair` could not actually
rebuild a damaged id index.

If a database ever returned rows and now returns none while `/verify` reports every object healthy,
that is the lost-id-index symptom and it is recoverable:

```bash
nedb-cli repair ./data
```

Replication consumers paging `/since`: gate historical catch-up on **`seq_index_ready`** from
`/status`, not on `scan_complete`. `scan_complete` is true on a warm boot precisely because the scan
was skipped, and before 2.8.6 `since` reported `has_more: false` in that state — which reads as
"caught up" on a database with every record unread.

## Install

```bash
pip install nedb-engine-client
```

Requires Python ≥ 3.8 and `httpx`.

---

## Quick start

```python
import asyncio
from nedb_client import NedbClient

async def main():
    async with NedbClient("http://127.0.0.1:7070", db="mydb") as db:

        # Write a document
        await db.put("blocks", "618000", {
            "height": 618000,
            "hash": "000000000000000000024bead8df69990852c202db0e0097c1a12ea637d7e96d",
            "tx_count": 2734,
        })

        # Query with NQL
        rows = await db.query("FROM blocks ORDER BY height DESC LIMIT 10")

        # Time-travel: what did the DB look like at seq 100?
        old = await db.query("FROM blocks AS OF 100 WHERE height > 600000")

        # Bi-temporal: what was true on 2024-06-15?
        valid = await db.query('FROM policy VALID AS OF "2024-06-15"')

        # Causal trace: why was this written?
        trace = await db.query("FROM blocks TRACE caused_by")

        # BLAKE2b Merkle head — changes on every write, anchorable
        head = await db.head()
        print(f"head: {head}")

        # Tamper-evidence check across all objects
        report = await db.verify()
        assert report["ok"], "tamper detected!"

asyncio.run(main())
```

## nedbd — start the server

```bash
pip install nedb-engine

# v1 AOF engine (default)
nedbd --data ./data

# v2 DAG engine (recommended — instant cold start, tamper-evident)
NEDBD_DAG=1 nedbd --data ./data

# With AES-256-GCM encryption
NEDBD_DAG=1 NEDB_TMK=<32-byte-hex> nedbd --data ./data

# With natural-language planning (see `cast` below)
#   needs a build with --features cast, plus model.cast in the data dir
NEDBD_DAG=1 NEDBD_CAST=1 nedbd --data ./data

# Check health
curl http://127.0.0.1:7070/health
# {"ok":true,"version":"3.2.0","service":"nedbd","encrypted":true}
```

## API reference

### Client lifecycle

```python
# Async context manager (recommended)
async with NedbClient(url, db=name, token=token) as db:
    ...

# Manual
db = NedbClient(url="http://127.0.0.1:7070", db="mydb", token="secret")
await db.open()
await db.close()
```

### Writes

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `await db.put(coll, id, doc, **opts)` | Write a document |
| `await db.delete(coll, id)` | Tombstone delete (history preserved in DAG) |
| `await db.batch(ops)` | Batch put/del in one HTTP round-trip |
| `await db.create_index(coll, field)` | Create sorted index for ORDER BY |

**Put options:**

```python
await db.put("claims", "c1", {"fact": "..."}, 
    caused_by=["abc123hash"],   # DAG causal provenance
    valid_from="2024-01-01",    # bi-temporal valid window
    valid_to="2024-12-31",
    evidence="sensor-42",       # human-readable provenance note
    confidence=0.95,            # confidence score 0–1
    idem="dedup-key",           # idempotency key
)
```

### Reads

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `await db.get(coll, id)` | Fetch current version of a document |
| `await db.query(nql)` | NQL query → list of dicts |
| `await db.query_full(nql)` | NQL query → full response (rows + seq + head) |

### NQL — NEDB Query Language

```
FROM <collection>
  [AS OF <seq>]                  transaction time (when was it written?)
  [VALID AS OF "<date>"]         valid time (when was it true in the world?)
  [WHERE field = value [AND ...]] op: = != < <= > >=
  [ORDER BY field [DESC]]
  [LIMIT n]
  [GROUP BY field COUNT|SUM|AVG|MIN|MAX]
  [TRACE caused_by [REVERSE]]    causal graph traversal
  [SEARCH "text"]                full-text search
```

### Cast — natural language into NQL

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `await db.cast(prompt, execute=False)` | English → dict (the plan) |
| `await db.cast_nql(prompt)` | English → just the NQL string |

Requires a daemon built with `--features cast` and started with `--cast`. A **3.33M-parameter** model ([nedb-cast-slm](https://github.com/aiassistsecure/nedb-cast-slm)) runs server-side on CPU — no API key, no per-token bill.

```python
plan = await db.cast("orders over 100")
# {'prompt': 'orders over 100',
#  'nql': 'FROM orders WHERE total > 100',
#  'valid': True,
#  'collection': 'orders',
#  'collection_known': True,
#  'collections': ['orders'],
#  'executed': False,
#  'seq': 3, 'head': '262fd9…'}
```

**`execute` defaults to `False` on purpose.** You get a plan to look at, not a query that already ran:

```python
if plan["valid"] and plan["collection_known"]:
    rows = await db.query(plan["nql"])          # review, then run

run = await db.cast("orders over 100", execute=True)
run["count"]   # 2
run["rows"]    # [...]
```

That default matters. A real miss from a real run:

```
prompt   "paid orders over 100"
nql      FROM orders WHERE status = "paid" LIMIT 100      ← wrong
correct  FROM orders WHERE status = "paid" AND total > 100
```

It read *"over 100"* as `LIMIT 100`. The count still came back correct **by coincidence** — both paid orders exceeded 100. Multi-predicate `WHERE` is the model's weakest clause (85.1% eval / 61.2% holdout). Show the plan to a human when you can.

**Errors are explicit, never empty results.** The server checks the plan against the collections this database actually has:

```python
try:
    await db.cast("show me all stylists")
except NedbError as e:
    e.status    # 422
    e.message   # collection "stylists" does not exist in "shop" (generated: 'FROM stylists')
```

Zero rows would read as *"no matching data"* — a lie, when the truth is the collection was imagined. Status **501** means the daemon was built without the feature, so you can detect the capability rather than guess at it.

### Integrity

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `await db.verify()` | BLAKE2b tamper-evidence check across all objects |
| `await db.head()` | Current Merkle root — changes on every write |
| `await db.seq()` | Current global sequence number |
| `await db.log(limit)` | Recent write log |
| `await db.checkpoint()` | Explicit checkpoint (no-op on v2 DAG) |

### Server management

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `await db.health()` | Server health — version, databases, encryption |
| `await db.ping()` | Boolean reachability check |
| `await db.list_databases()` | All databases on this server |
| `await db.create_database()` | Create this database explicitly |
| `await db.drop_database()` | Drop this database (irreversible) |

## Error handling

```python
from nedb_client import NedbClient, NedbError

async with NedbClient("http://127.0.0.1:7070", db="mydb") as db:
    try:
        await db.put("coll", "id", {"data": "value"})
    except NedbError as e:
        print(f"HTTP {e.status}: {e.message}")
```

Queries on missing collections return `[]` rather than raising — resilient by default.
