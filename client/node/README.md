## ⚠️ Upgrade your server to nedbd 3.2.0

This client talks to `nedbd`, so its durability comes from the server. **Upgrade if you are on
anything earlier than 3.2.0.**

**3.2.0 — the embedded engine was pinning its own data directory.** The background flush ticker held
a strong reference to the database in a loop that never exited, so the handle was never dropped: the
exclusive data-dir `LOCK` was never released, reopening the same path in the same process failed with
"locked by another process" naming your *own* pid, and every open leaked a thread and the whole
database for the life of the process. Live in **2.8.5 through 3.1.0**.

**2.8.6 fixed three defects in 2.8.5 and earlier** — a flush that hit a full disk silently discarded
acknowledged writes, flush failures were unobservable, and `nedb-cli repair` could not actually
rebuild a damaged id index.

If a database ever returned rows and now returns none while `/verify` reports every object healthy,
that is the lost-id-index symptom and it is recoverable:

```bash
nedb-cli repair ./data
```

Replication consumers paging `/since`: gate historical catch-up on **`seq_index_ready`** from
`/status`, not on `scan_complete`. `scan_complete` is true on a warm boot precisely because the scan
was skipped, and before 2.8.6 `since` reported `has_more: false` in that state — which reads as
"caught up" on a database with every record unread.

## Install

```bash
npm install nedb-engine-client
```

Requires Node.js ≥ 18 (uses native `fetch`). Works in modern browsers too.

---

## Quick start

```typescript
import { NedbClient } from "nedb-engine-client";

const db = new NedbClient({ url: "http://127.0.0.1:7070", db: "mydb" });

// Write a document
await db.put("blocks", "618000", {
    height: 618000,
    hash: "000000000000000000024bead8df69990852c202db0e0097c1a12ea637d7e96d",
    txCount: 2734,
});

// Query with NQL
const rows = await db.query("FROM blocks ORDER BY height DESC LIMIT 10");

// Time-travel: what did the DB look like at seq 100?
const old = await db.query("FROM blocks AS OF 100 WHERE height > 600000");

// Bi-temporal: what was true on 2024-06-15?
const valid = await db.query('FROM policy VALID AS OF "2024-06-15"');

// BLAKE2b Merkle head — changes on every write, anchorable
const head = await db.head();

// Tamper-evidence check across all objects
const report = await db.verify();
console.assert(report.ok, "tamper detected!");
```

## nedbd — start the server

```bash
npm install nedb-engine   # or: pip install nedb-engine

# v2 DAG engine (recommended — instant cold start, tamper-evident)
NEDBD_DAG=1 nedbd --data ./data

# With natural-language planning (see `cast` below)
#   needs a build with --features cast, plus model.cast in the data dir
NEDBD_DAG=1 NEDBD_CAST=1 nedbd --data ./data

# Check health
curl http://127.0.0.1:7070/health
# {"ok":true,"version":"3.2.0","service":"nedbd","encrypted":true}
```

## API reference

### Constructor

```typescript
const db = new NedbClient({
    url:            "http://127.0.0.1:7070",  // nedbd base URL
    db:             "mydb",                    // database name
    token:          "secret",                  // bearer auth (optional)
    autoCreate:     true,                      // create DB on first write
    readTimeoutMs:  3_000,                     // query timeout
    writeTimeoutMs: 30_000,                    // write timeout
});
```

### Writes

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `db.put(coll, id, doc, opts?)` | Write a document |
| `db.delete(coll, id)` | Tombstone delete (history preserved in DAG) |
| `db.batch(ops)` | Batch put/del in one HTTP round-trip |
| `db.createIndex(coll, field)` | Create sorted index for ORDER BY |

**Put options:**

```typescript
await db.put("claims", "c1", { fact: "..." }, {
    causedBy:   ["abc123hash"],  // DAG causal provenance
    validFrom:  "2024-01-01",    // bi-temporal valid window
    validTo:    "2024-12-31",
    evidence:   "sensor-42",     // human-readable provenance note
    confidence: 0.95,            // confidence score 0–1
    idem:       "dedup-key",     // idempotency key
});
```

### Reads

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `db.get(coll, id)` | Fetch current version of a document |
| `db.query(nql)` | NQL query → array of objects |
| `db.queryFull(nql)` | NQL query → full response (rows + seq + head) |

### NQL — NEDB Query Language

```
FROM <collection>
  [AS OF <seq>]                  transaction time (when was it written?)
  [VALID AS OF "<date>"]         valid time (when was it true in the world?)
  [WHERE field = value [AND ...]] op: = != < <= > >=
  [ORDER BY field [DESC]]
  [LIMIT n]
  [GROUP BY field COUNT|SUM|AVG|MIN|MAX]
  [TRACE caused_by [REVERSE]]    causal graph traversal
  [SEARCH "text"]                full-text search
```

### Cast — natural language into NQL

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `db.cast(prompt, opts?)` | English → `CastResult` (the plan). `opts.execute` defaults to `false` |
| `db.castNql(prompt)` | English → just the NQL string |

Requires a daemon built with `--features cast` and started with `--cast`. A **3.33M-parameter** model ([nedb-cast-slm](https://github.com/aiassistsecure/nedb-cast-slm)) runs server-side on CPU — no API key, no per-token bill.

```typescript
const plan = await db.cast("orders over 100");
// {
//   nql: 'FROM orders WHERE total > 100',
//   valid: true,
//   collection: 'orders',
//   collection_known: true,
//   collections: ['orders'],
//   executed: false,
//   seq: 3, head: '262fd9…'
// }
```

**`execute` defaults to `false` on purpose.** You get a plan to look at, not a query that already ran:

```typescript
if (plan.valid && plan.collection_known) {
  const rows = await db.query(plan.nql);        // review, then run
}

const run = await db.cast("orders over 100", { execute: true });
run.count;  // 2
run.rows;   // [...]
```

That default matters. A real miss from a real run:

```
prompt   "paid orders over 100"
nql      FROM orders WHERE status = "paid" LIMIT 100      ← wrong
correct  FROM orders WHERE status = "paid" AND total > 100
```

It read *"over 100"* as `LIMIT 100`. The count still came back correct **by coincidence** — both paid orders exceeded 100. Multi-predicate `WHERE` is the model's weakest clause (85.1% eval / 61.2% holdout). Show the plan to a human when you can.

**Errors are explicit, never empty results.** The server checks the plan against the collections this database actually has:

```typescript
try {
  await db.cast("show me all stylists");
} catch (e) {
  if (e instanceof NedbError) {
    e.status;   // 422
    e.message;  // collection "stylists" does not exist in "shop" (generated: "FROM stylists")
  }
}
```

Zero rows would read as *"no matching data"* — a lie, when the truth is the collection was imagined. Status **501** means the daemon was built without the feature, so you can detect the capability rather than guess at it.

### Integrity

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `db.verify()` | BLAKE2b tamper-evidence check across all objects |
| `db.head()` | Current Merkle root — changes on every write |
| `db.seq()` | Current global sequence number |
| `db.log(limit?)` | Recent write log |
| `db.checkpoint()` | Explicit checkpoint (no-op on v2 DAG) |

### Server management

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `db.health()` | Server health — version, databases, encryption |
| `db.ping()` | Boolean reachability check |
| `db.listDatabases()` | All databases on this server |
| `db.createDatabase()` | Create this database explicitly |
| `db.dropDatabase()` | Drop this database (irreversible) |

---

## Error handling

```typescript
import { NedbClient, NedbError } from "nedb-engine-client";

try {
    await db.put("coll", "id", { data: "value" });
} catch (e) {
    if (e instanceof NedbError) {
        console.error(`HTTP ${e.status}: ${e.message}`);
    }
}
```

Queries on missing collections return `[]` rather than throwing — resilient by default.

---

## Batch writes

```typescript
await db.batch([
    { op: "put", coll: "blocks", id: "618001", doc: { height: 618001 } },
    { op: "put", coll: "blocks", id: "618002", doc: { height: 618002 } },
    { op: "del", coll: "blocks", id: "617999" },
]);
```

One HTTP request, multiple ops — best throughput for bulk ingestion.
